# Living Building
https://ngsuwen.github.io/living-building/suwen-ng

I decided to pick up HTML and CSS after my architectural thesis to build a webpage to showcase my final project. What started as a small personal project eventually became a life-changing moment. It was during this period that I realise that I enjoy coding, and I want to pursue this full time. Hence, I decided to change my career from an architect to a software engineer, bringing my experience in technology and design from the physical world, to the digital world.

The code is very messy but I think its not a bad attempt for a first timer, right? :satisfied:

## Technologies
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **Vanilla JavaScript** is used to manage slideshows
